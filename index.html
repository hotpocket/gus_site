      People love a great story. Now with the prevalence of high quality/low cost video technology you don't have to be a Hollywood star to make a great visual story, and that's where Opificer Media comes in. We want to help you share your story. Video is no longer only for multimillion dollar studios and companies, technology has opened the opportunities for everyone to capture brilliant imagery and thus allow one to share their love, life, message, talents, products, business or art with the masses.<br><br>
      Who are we to be so bold to and privileged to offer to share your visual story? We are a start up videography company founded and led by Gustavo Guardado, Jr.  Gus, as most people call him, has a passion for videography but more importantly in telling stories through motion pictures. He's an accomplished videographer, director, writer, producer, and editor. He received his master's of fine art in film production in 2005. Recently, Gus proudly released his first independent feature film: Love, Concord which premiered at the 2012 HBO NY Latino Film Festival and was released on iTunes and Hulu in 2013. Gus is a skilled artist and that's where the name Opificer comes from, it's an old English word literally meaning "skilled artist."<br><br>
      So what's your story? Because Opificer Media wants to help you tell it. Is it your wedding story? Gus has been shooting weddings for over 15 years! Are you a business that needs a commercial, wouldn't you rather have a cinematically educated director help you shoot it than some corporate cable company that just sees business first and artistic creativity second? Is your story about your athletic talents? Then why not let us help you put together you scouting video of your best performances, interviews, and achievements?<br><br>
      Lastly, Opificer Media is about giving young and hungry videographers their opportunity to thrive as artist. Gus is a Video Teacher at Heritage High School and some of his stable of videographers are former or current students. Thus, Opificer Media gives high school students much needed real world experience to not only better students education of videography, but work experience to kickstart their careers. Many of Gus' former students/videgraphers have moved on to become accomplished video editors, independent filmmakers, and even journalists.<br><br>So when you choose Opificer Media to help you tell your story via video you'll always get a product that's creative and which puts the art first and the profit margins last. We want to make art of your story, and a video you're proud to share with the world.
